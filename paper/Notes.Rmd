## Rethink $Sigma^*$

$$
V(\epsilon_t) = \Psi V(\epsilon_{t-1})\Psi + \Sigma
$$
If stationary, then it must hold that $V(\epsilon_t) =V(\epsilon_{t-1}) = \Sigma_0$
So we can find $\Sigma_0$ by 
$$
vec(\Sigma_0)=(I-\Psi \otimes \Psi)^{-1}vec(\Sigma)
$$
For the covariance we have
$$
COV(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1}) = COV(\Psi\epsilon_{t-1}, \epsilon_{t-1}) = \Psi \Sigma_0
$$

### Estimation using full $\Psi$
1. For the estimation of full Psi, the current issue is the fact that the matrix Sigma ^ * will not be a correlation matrix as Psi need not have entries that are less than 1. So the best idea would be to use a covariance structure for Sigma^* and constraints on the thetas?

2. Can any further constraints on Psi be derived?

Var(y_t) = var(eps) =
