Description: A flexible framework for fitting multivariate ordinal regression models with
  composite likelihood methods to three dimensional panel data. The package extends R
  package mvord with a further multiple measurement object and a further correlation
  structure, to accommodate for multiple measurements which exhibit cross-sectional
  and longitudinal dependence. Medium-term the functionalities will be incorporated
  in package mvord.
